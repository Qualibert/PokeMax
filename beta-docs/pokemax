Setup guide:

1) PokeNav bot (<https://pokenavbot.com/>) must be in your server for most features to work.
2) Invite PokeMax bot in your Discord server.
3) Go into your server roles settings and make sure that PokeMax role is above raid-viewer and raid-moderator.
4) Run the ``$pokemax`` command inside the channel that you will use as the pokemax-moderation channel (recommended that you actually use the #pokenav channel).
5) You may need the tasker/plus app if you want the plus features (check patreon, check google play link).

Pokemax will ask:

1) Hi! Thank for using PokeMax, this wizard will guide you throught the main setup. You can use ``[pre]info`` to get help on the bot.
First, (PokeMax uses ``$gtc`` see if it's responding or the correct prefix). Else:
It seems that either PokeNav bot is not using the default prefix (``$``) or don't have permissions to write in this channel.
Please make sure the permissions are correct then type rerun ``pokemax`` or ``$setup prefix [?]``
(use ``$stc`` to be: ``PokeNav test suceeded!``) 

2) is this the #pokenav moderation channel? Else, send the channel mention (auto approuve or change text if it's named "pokenav"?. 
Maybe search for it by name if not found and prompt for it

3) Find the #active-raids channel
4) Find the raid-lobby channel (multiples :S?)
5) Find the general-chat channel (?)
6) Set the moderation role, admin-role.
